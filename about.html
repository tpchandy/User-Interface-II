    <h1> ABOUT </h1>
    I live and work in Columbus,Ohio.Have been living here in the US since 2003. Have been more of a Sales person all my life, 
    and the most recent full-time job in Sales has been with UPS Freight. I currently work part-time with a distribution warehouse out here in Columbus,
    while attending lambda School.I have a background in adverstising & marketing, and in recent years have been growing very curious about online selling
    and marketplaces.I have been fortunate to get acceptedin this mastery based education which for sure will give me the wings to gain flight into the 
    passionate career that I now want for myself...to be a web developer, and to bring in all my learning, experiences, and skill sets so far in life, to work
    together and churn out work I can truely be proud of!
